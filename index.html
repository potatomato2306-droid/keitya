                <p id="poem">We weren’t sure about us.<br/>
We weren’t sure if we would meet again.<br/>
We weren’t sure if what we felt was real.<br/>
We weren’t sure if those tears meant something.<br/>
We weren’t sure if the fear of losing each other was true.<br/>
We weren’t sure if our bodies fit,<br/>
or if our eyes were telling the truth.<br/>
We weren’t sure if waves and curls could belong together.<br/>
We weren’t sure if twinning was needed,<br/>
or if being different was enough.<br/><br/>

We weren’t sure of the paths we came from,<br/>
or the paths we might walk together.<br/>
We weren’t sure we would see each other that day.<br/>
We weren’t sure we could be eachother's <i>bubbly</i>, and <i>kanna</i>.<br/>
We weren’t sure if silence meant comfort<br/>
or if distance meant goodbye.<br/>
We weren’t sure if this was love,<br/>
or just the beginning of learning how to feel.<br/>

But in all that not knowing,<br/>
we kept choosing to stay a little longer,<br/>
and maybe that was the truest thing we knew.</p>

                <p id="poem">There is happiness in seeing you waiting for me.<br/>
There is happiness in hugging you, forgetting the world around us.<br/>
There is happiness in hearing you say, “I am in love with you.”<br/>
There is happiness when you open up and I learn your past.<br/>
There is happiness in going home, with my home dropping me there.<br/>
There is happiness in you staying another day for me.<br/>
There is happiness in sleeping with your fragrance on me,<br/>
knowing I can see you again tomorrow.<br/><br/>

There is happiness in seeing you in formals<br/>
and falling for you all over again.<br/>
There is happiness in wearing jhumkas you got for me.<br/>
There is happiness in wearing kumkum from your hands.<br/>
There is happiness in eating laddoo from your hands.<br/>
There is happiness in walking hand in hand,<br/>
in playing on the swing with you.<br/>
There is happiness in getting tense about families,<br/>
and even when the train gets cancelled.<br/>
There is happiness in a single reel,<br/>
and in sharing a dosa.<br/>

There is happiness in small moments,<br/>
even when we are unsure what to call this.<br/>
There is happiness in not knowing the future,<br/>
but still choosing each other today.<br/>
There is happiness in loving slowly,<br/>
without promises, without certainty.<br/><br/>

But there is no happiness in saying goodbye.<br/>
There is no happiness in letting go of your hand.<br/>
There is no happiness in the call after we leave.<br/>
Yet, there is happiness with no reason to explain<br/>
because we know this time,<br/>
we will meet again.<br/><br/>

You are my happy place,<br/>
and that is why I call you home.</p>

Not new, not old.<br/>
The light on our faces when we see each other.<br/>
Not new, not old, going on bike rides..<br/>
but with you, I can still feel you.<br/><br/>

Not new, not old, the mountain view<br/>
and playing with tralala, hahaha.<br/>
Not new, not old..<br/>
jhumkas, kadi,<br/>
your hands choosing them for me,<br/>
my heart keeping them forever.<br/>
Not new, not old..<br/>
Kondapalli roads,<br/>
dosa shared,<br/>
time slowing down just enough.<br/><br/>

Not new, not old.. me trying to capture you,<br/>
failing at photographs, succeeding at remembering.<br/>
Not new, not old, buying water at double the price.<br/>
Not new, not old, getting blessings from them,<br/>
which came in the form of a song..<br/>
and you didn’t even know.<br/>
Not new, not old.. you in Vijayawada,<br/>
me away from you,<br/>
the distance suddenly heavy.<br/><br/>

Not new, not old.. taking my home to our home,<br/>
you speaking to your mother outside my house,<br/>
like you already belong.<br/>
Not new, not old, finding my way till A-1<br/>
just to walk into naked you.<br/>
Not new, not old.. paneer rice, shared drinks,<br/>
my first and last cigarette,<br/>
moments we don’t know we repeat, but won’t forget.<br/>
Not new, not old, going to the station together,<br/>
tripping on the escalator.. only for you to have my back.<br/>
Not new, not old.. watching you moving away,<br/>
me walking faster, waving higher,<br/>
hurting just to stay seen.<br/>
Not new, not old.. tears waiting behind my eyes<br/>
while your camera keeps rolling.<br/>
Not new, not old.. the space you leave behind,<br/>
still shaped like you.<br/>
Not new, not old.. every road way back home is you.<br/><br/>

Not new, not old.. the same heavy call,<br/>
words careful, hearts unsure.<br/><br/>

Not new, not old.. not calling it love,<br/>
not walking away either.<br/>
Just hope,<br/>
quiet and stubborn,<br/>
believing we are still choosing <i>each other</i>.<br/>

Despite the lie, we met.<br/>
Despite the misunderstanding, we stayed.<br/>
Despite the ego, our hearts stayed open.<br/>
Despite the arguments, we breathed.<br/>
Despite the breaking, we did not leave.<br/>
Despite the words that hurt, there were hands that healed.<br/>
Despite the silence, we learned how to speak.<br/><br/>

Despite you understanding my dress isn’t the problem<br/>
and not asking me to wear it,<br/>
yet coming up with ideas to make me comfortable.<br/>
Despite tolerating my moods,<br/>
despite thinking about not hurting my feelings,<br/>
despite your hands adjusting my hair..<br/>
the purest form of love I have ever known.<br/><br/>

Despite wearing black pants even though you’re uncomfortable<br/>
just for a few minutes of my joy.<br/>
Despite saying, “<i>I don’t show feelings</i>,”<br/>
I see care in every move you make.<br/>
Despite doing so much for me,<br/>
here I am—useless and worrying you.<br/>
Despite the scratches,<br/>
loving while fixing what we almost lost.<br/>
Staying. Fixing. Learning each other.<br/><br/>

I mean, the cracks do let the light in, Adi.<br/>
Fourth meets aren’t soft... they’re honest.<br/>
Despite still not wanting to let go of your handshake,<br/>
yet waving high again.<br/>
Despite tears,<br/>
I saw something else this time..<br/>
the peace of knowing we’re not leaving each other.<br/><br/>

Despite not knowing if this is love,<br/>
our smiles grew brighter with each meet says the pictures.<br/>
And maybe that is enough.</p>
